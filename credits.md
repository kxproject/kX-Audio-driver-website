kX Audio Driver and kX mixer were written by me, Eugene Gavrilov.
The kX Audio Driver is Freeware, but since I have spent many hours working on this program, I would appreciate any donations which you can offer/spare.

I would like to thank Hanz Petrov from the Independent EMU10K1 Programmers Site for his support; Soeren Bovbjerg for driver testing and feedback; Friedemann Wolpert for Web Hosting, Dennis Samuelsson and Luki Goldschmidt for the kX Site mirrors and web-hosting.

I also appreciate all of the feedback, messages and e-mails that people have sent.

I would like to thank the people at opensource.creative.com, especially Daniel Bertrand and Rui Sousa. Thanks to Fabio Bizzetti for his work on how to fix the inter-channel and inter-converter delays on AC97 / I2S CODECs. Also, thanks to Sergey Komarinsky for C++ code optimizations.

I would like to thank Vedran "RIV@NVX" Miletic for BETA testing, bug reports, Croatian translation, help and screenshots updating and some ideas.

Thanks to Chris "dj_stick" Stannard for working on kX Knowledgebase articles.

My greetings also go to the Creative/EMU engineers for their hardware.
